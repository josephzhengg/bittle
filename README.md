## 📖 What is Bittle?
Bittle is a **web application** that streamlines the process of creating “families” in organizations — a tradition where members are paired as **bigs** and **littles**.  

Instead of juggling Google Forms, spreadsheets, and DMs, Bittle gives you a **centralized, easy-to-use platform** to collect member preferences and generate families in minutes.
